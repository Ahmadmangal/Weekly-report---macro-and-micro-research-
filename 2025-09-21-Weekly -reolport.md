# Weekly Market Research — Week Ending September 20, 2025  
*Uploaded Sep 22 PKT — researcher: Muhammad Ahmad*

## Weekly Recap
- **S&P 500** gained **+0.74%** for the week, holding near all-time highs despite mid-week volatility around the FOMC decision.  
- **Nasdaq-100 (NDX)** added **+0.95%**, buoyed by strong semiconductor earnings and a late-week rebound in megacaps after Thursday’s profit-taking.  
- **Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA)** climbed **+0.63%**, outperforming midweek as defensive sectors rotated into favor.  
- **Gold** ended the week **+0.41%**, supported by post-Fed dollar softness earlier in the week before Friday’s modest pullback.  
- **U.S. Dollar Index (DXY)** finished nearly flat after an early dip was offset by Friday’s recovery.  
- **10-Year Treasury Yield** rose from **4.06% → 4.19%**, reflecting a hawkish repricing even after the Fed’s cut.  
- **Oil (WTI)** advanced **+1.2%** on OPEC+ supply discipline and resilient global demand signals.

## Key Macro Drivers
- **Federal Reserve:** On Wednesday, the Fed cut rates by **25bps** to a target range of **4.75–5.00%**, a widely expected move.  
  - Chair Powell stressed a **“meeting-by-meeting”** approach, highlighting the need for more data before confirming a series of consecutive cuts.  
  - The **dot plot** showed a median of **two additional cuts** by year-end, slightly below market hopes for three.  
- **Economic Data:**  
  - **Jobless claims** remained subdued, pointing to a still-tight labor market.  
  - **Housing starts** softened, signaling rate-sensitive sectors continue to cool.  
  - **Global PMIs** from Europe and Asia indicated modest manufacturing stabilization.

## Microstructure Insights
- **Treasury Futures:** Heavy dealer hedging and foreign real-money demand early in the week gave way to profit-taking as yields climbed post-Fed.  
- **Options Market:** Implied volatility fell sharply after the Fed event, with S&P gamma positioning shifting positive and dampening intraday swings.  
- **Equity Flow:** Dark pool activity in megacap tech suggested short-term profit taking midweek followed by late-week bargain hunting.

## Cross-Asset Takeaways
- Rate-sensitive equities (high-growth tech, REITs) wobbled after the cut as higher long-term yields offset the near-term policy easing.  
- Commodities benefited from dollar softness early in the week, though gains moderated by Friday.  
- Credit spreads tightened slightly, reflecting steady risk appetite.

## Looking Ahead
- All eyes on **upcoming CPI and PCE data** for confirmation that inflation is cooling fast enough to justify further cuts.  
- Watch **Treasury auctions** for signs of demand strength as yields hover near multi-month highs.  
- Global traders remain focused on China’s growth data and potential stimulus announcements.
