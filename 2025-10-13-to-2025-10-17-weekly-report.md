## Market Overview
U.S. equities **rebounded** during the week as investors digested mixed economic data and shifting rate expectations.  
- **S&P 500 (SPX):** **+1.1%**  
- **Nasdaq-100 (NDX):** **+1.4%**  
- **Dow Jones (DJI):** **+0.9%**

The rebound followed the prior week’s selloff, with strong inflows into tech and financials helping stabilize sentiment.  
However, higher Treasury yields limited gains in rate-sensitive sectors, and volatility remained elevated around **VIX 22–23**.

## Fed & Macro Developments
- Fed speakers signaled a **data-dependent** stance after September’s 25-bps cut, emphasizing flexibility.  
- Market pricing now implies a **70% chance** of another cut at the November FOMC meeting, though some officials hinted at a pause if inflation stabilizes.  
- The **government shutdown risk** faded slightly as a short-term funding extension passed the House, reducing short-term uncertainty.  
- Inflation data stayed mixed: **CPI core** slightly cooled while **PPI** surprised higher, reinforcing the Fed’s cautious tone.

## Bonds & Rates
The **10-year Treasury yield** rose sharply — up **~0.9% on Friday alone** — as investors rotated out of safe havens and braced for additional supply.  
Short-end yields moved less, leaving the **2s10s curve modestly steepened**.  
Higher yields reflected stronger growth data and Fed officials’ reluctance to commit to deeper easing.  
Bond market liquidity remained thin, amplifying moves during the latter part of the week.

## Commodities
A rough week for metals:  
- **Gold:** **−1.75%** on Friday, closing near **$3,885/oz**  
- **Silver:** **−4.2%** weekly drop  
- **WTI Crude:** traded near **$63–64**, essentially flat week-over-week  

Rising yields and a firmer dollar reduced demand for non-yielding assets, while oil stabilized on mixed OPEC output signals and tepid demand data.

---

## Dollar & FX
- **U.S. Dollar Index (DXY):** **+0.2%** on the week  
Dollar strength came mainly from yield differentials and short-covering. The yen weakened further as Japanese authorities hinted at no near-term intervention.

---

## Sector Highlights
- **Tech:** Outperformed, led by semiconductors and AI-linked stocks.  
- **Financials:** Benefited from higher yields, lifting banks.  
- **Metals & Miners:** Hit hard by falling commodity prices.  
- **Energy:** Stable, tracking sideways crude.

## Cross-Asset & Microstructure View
Flows indicated **risk-on positioning** returning mid-week, especially in tech and cyclicals. However, late-week order books showed declining bid depth in metals and Treasury futures — likely from deleveraging funds adjusting duration exposure.  
Cross-asset correlations rose slightly as equity–bond divergence widened, typical in tightening liquidity phases.

---

## Weekly Summary
Markets staged a **partial rebound** but under the surface, higher yields and stronger dollar pointed to tightening financial conditions.  
The Fed’s cautious communication kept rate-cut hopes alive, yet liquidity and positioning suggest continued volatility into late October.
