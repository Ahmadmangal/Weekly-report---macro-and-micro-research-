### **Equities**

Markets suffered a major setback this week as profit-taking and rate uncertainty hit risk sentiment.  
The **S&P 500 (SPX)** lost **–2.3%**, the **Nasdaq-100 (NDX)** plunged **–3.1%**, and the **Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI)** declined **–1.8%**.  
Tech stocks, which had fueled much of the year’s rally, faced sharp pullbacks — especially in semiconductors and mega-cap names — as investors rotated toward defensive sectors.  
Volatility jumped sharply late in the week, reflecting fears that the Fed’s rate path could remain restrictive for longer.

### **Federal Reserve & Macro Developments**

Fed commentary continued to dominate markets.  
Officials reiterated their cautious stance, emphasizing that inflation remains above target even as growth shows signs of cooling.  
Several FOMC members hinted that another **25 bp cut** could come later this month if labor data and inflation expectations weaken further.  
The **U.S. government shutdown** persisted, delaying key data releases and forcing investors to rely on private-sector estimates — a factor adding uncertainty to forecasts.  
Meanwhile, private data from ADP pointed to a **slower job market**, reinforcing the case for potential easing by year-end.

### **Bonds and Rates**

Bond yields eased late in the week as equities sold off.  
The **10-Year Treasury yield** fell to **~4.05%**, down from 4.18% earlier in the week, marking a shift into safe-haven assets.  
The **2s10s curve** flattened slightly but remained positive, a sign that markets still expect softer growth in 2026 rather than immediate recession risks.  
Futures now price in nearly **100% odds of a Fed cut** at the next meeting, according to CME FedWatch.

### **Commodities**

Commodities were the week’s standout winners.  
**Gold** surged above the **$4,000/oz** mark — a psychological barrier — and closed near **$4,050**, up roughly **+3%** for the week.  
**Silver** gained nearly **+4%**, supported by haven demand and industrial use optimism.  
**Oil (WTI crude)** ended roughly flat, hovering near **$63–$64 per barrel**, after alternating between supply concerns and growth worries.

### **Currencies**

The **U.S. Dollar Index (DXY)** slipped **–0.5%** for the week, reflecting softening yields and renewed rate-cut expectations.  
Investors favored gold and other non-dollar assets amid Fed uncertainty.  
The euro and yen both gained modestly, while emerging-market FX stabilized as the dollar lost some of its defensive bid.

### **Cross-Asset Takeaway**

This week encapsulated a clear **risk-off rotation**: equities tumbled, yields fell, and commodities rallied.  
Investors appear to be preparing for a slower U.S. economy in 2026, a potentially dovish Fed pivot, and lingering inflation pressure that keeps safe-haven demand strong.  
While U.S. indices remain near record highs, the market tone has shifted — traders are watching whether upcoming Fed communications can calm volatility or spark a deeper correction.
