## Macro Focus  
- **US Nonfarm Payrolls (Aug):** Jobs grew **22k vs ~75k forecast**, with unemployment rising to **4.3%** → weakest print in months.  
   [Reuters – US jobs report](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-job-growth-slows-august-unemployment-rate-rises-2025-09-05/)  

- **Fed implications:** Markets repriced a **September rate cut** as highly likely; a **50 bps cut** is now seen as a tail risk scenario.

## Market Recap  
- **S&P 500:** +0.84% — volatility as traders weighed weaker labor vs. easing hopes.  
- **Nasdaq 100:** +0.93%.  
- **Dow Jones:** +0.3%.  
- **US10Y yield:** fell ~8 bps.  [Reuters – Treasury yields](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us-treasury-yields-fall-after-nfp-2025-09-05/)  
- **Gold:** +1.1%, near $3,600/oz, safe-haven + easing play.  [Reuters – gold rally](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/gold-jumps-us-jobs-report-2025-09-05/)  
- **Oil:** modest rebound as supply focus returned.  

## Cross-Asset Insights  
- **Equities:** Relief bid, but some desks caution “cuts alone won’t sustain a rally” without better growth.  
- **Bonds:** Bullish flattening; front-end led as cut odds repriced.  
- **Commodities:** Gold saw ETF inflows; oil traders eye OPEC commentary.  

## Street Commentary  
- **BofA/MS:** Base case → 25 bps cut in September; more through year-end if labor data weakens.  
- **Others:** 50 bps cut conceivable if deterioration accelerates.  [Reuters – Fed cut scenarios](https://www.reuters.com/markets/fed-cuts-50bps-scenario-2025-09-05/)  

## Reflection  
The NFP miss reframed the market narrative: **from sticky inflation risk → to labor weakness giving Fed cover to ease**. Next week’s CPI + claims are pivotal confirmation points.
