## Macro & Trade Developments  
- Progress in U.S.–China trade negotiations sparked risk appetite. Officials indicated a potential framework ahead of a summit between Donald Trump and Xi Jinping, easing fears of renewed tariff escalation. 7  
- Inflation data came in softer than feared, supporting hopes for eventual Fed easing. 8  
- The ongoing U.S. government shutdown remained a wild card, with economic-data flow disrupted and investor caution elevated. 9

## Commodities & Safe-Havens  
Precious metals pulled back as risk assets regained favor:  
- **Gold:** Declined ~1% or more; safe-haven demand eased. 10  
- **Silver:** Also slid, following gold’s lead and weaker industrial demand outlook.  
- Oil and base metals were mixed, with trade optimism offsetting demand concerns.

## Currencies & Rates  
- The **U.S. Dollar Index (DXY)** edged higher, supported by stronger yields and risk-on flows.  
- Treasury yields ticked up, particularly on the back of tech strength and trade-volume increases, tempering some of the commodity-linked upside.

## Summary & Outlook  
This week’s market bounce was powered by blockbuster tech earnings and a thaw in U.S.–China trade relations — but under the surface, tightening policy risks and disrupted data flows from the shutdown remain headwinds.  
Look ahead to next week for:  
- Major Fed commentary and balance-sheet updates  
- Fresh inflation and employment data  
- Key earnings from industrials and financials  
These could determine whether the current run holds or gives way to a deeper rotation.
