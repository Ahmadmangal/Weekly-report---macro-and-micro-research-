## Major U.S. Equity Indices

All three benchmark indexes climbed over **1%** in the week. In fact, *“the three major U.S. stock indexes climbed more than 1% for the week.”*  
By Friday’s close, the **S&P 500 (SPX)** and **Dow Jones (DJI)** were each up about **+1.1%**, and the **Nasdaq-100 (NDX)** (tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite proxy) rose roughly **+1.3%**.  
Each index traded at or near all-time highs by week’s end, extending a string of record closes. (September capped a strong quarter: e.g. S&P +3.5% in Sept, +7.8% in Q3.)  
Tech stocks outperformed slightly, helping Nasdaq lead. Overall breadth was healthy, with more advancers than decliners.

## Fed and Economic Data

Fed communications and data releases were mixed. Fed minutes and speeches reaffirmed a cautious easing bias.  
After its Sept 16–17 meeting the **Fed cut rates 25bp** to a **4.00–4.25% target** and signaled more cuts ahead.  
Fed Governor **Stephen Miran** again called for aggressive cuts, saying policy has become “more restrictive,” though other officials warned inflation remains elevated.  

Meanwhile, the **U.S. government shutdown** froze official data: the BLS halted releases and the Sept jobs report was delayed.  
In lieu of BLS data, **private ADP payroll figures showed a surprise 32,000 decline** in September, reinforcing signs of labor-market cooling.  
Markets are now bracing for **Fed minutes (FOMC Oct. 7)** and speeches to clarify the path forward.

## Bond Market and Interest Rates

U.S. Treasury yields softened as rate-cut bets firmed. The **10-year yield eased to about 4.08%** by Friday (from ~4.15% mid-week),  
while the **2–10 curve remained positively sloped (~0.5% spread)**.  
The slide reflects heightened easing expectations: Fed funds futures are now **~95% priced for a 25bp cut** at the late-Oct meeting.  

Credit markets also responded: corporate bond spreads tightened marginally amid robust demand for yield.  
Overall, the bond market is marking time ahead of the next FOMC, with yields a bit lower and the curve slightly flatter.

## Commodities

Safe-havens surged while energy slumped.  
**Gold** rocketed to new record highs (~$3,900/oz), up about **+3%** on the week, as traders bought insurance against policy uncertainty.  
**Silver** leapt roughly **+3.4%**.  

By contrast, **oil prices tumbled**: **WTI crude slid about –7%** for the week, ending near the low-$60s (WTI had closed ~$66 last week).  
OPEC supply worries and easing global demand expectations kept downward pressure on crude.  
A California refinery fire gave only a brief lift.  

Base metals and agricultural commodities saw modest moves: copper and grains were mixed, partly reflecting the strong dollar earlier in the month and now the flip in macro bets.

## Currencies

The **U.S. dollar** was modestly weaker. The **DXY index fell about –0.1%** to roughly *97.7* by Friday.  
The greenback’s decline reflects Fed easing bets and positioning. Traders now heavily price in Fed cuts (**CME FedWatch shows ~95% odds of an Oct cut**),  
and a Reuters poll noted strategists remain net short the dollar as they expect further Fed easing.  

In fact, the **dollar is down ~10% YTD** while **gold has surged ~47%**, underscoring the move into non-USD safe-havens.  
Currency markets broadly favored pro-cyclical currencies (euro, yen, commodity FX), with even minor gains for USD crosses.

## Sector and Notable Stock Movers

Tech and cyclicals saw the biggest swings.  
**Tesla** dropped sharply (**–3.4%**) after its record Q3 deliveries report — investors warned that post-tax-credit demand would fall off, a classic *“sell-the-news”* reaction.  
In semiconductors, **Applied Materials** fell over **2%** on export-restriction news.  

By contrast, defensive sectors (utilities, staples) and some financials outperformed as the recovery outlook remained uncertain.  
Large-cap banks gained modestly on solid earnings guidance. Retail and consumer shares were mixed.  

Overall market breadth was positive: more stocks rose than fell, and many sectors that underperformed earlier in the month participated in the bounce.

## Cross-Asset and Macro View

The week’s action reflected a tug-of-war between **risk-on and risk-off** forces.  
U.S. stocks hit fresh highs and even **Bitcoin rallied (to ~$120k)**, signaling bullish sentiment despite the shutdown.  
At the same time, traditional havens rallied: gold and Treasuries moved higher, implying caution.  

Investors seem positioned for Fed easing — equities and commodities climbed on hopes of lower rates,  
while bonds and gold held firm on uncertainty. **Volatility remained low (VIX ~16–17)**, highlighting complacency.  

In summary, equity and crypto gains coexisted with a weakening dollar and soaring gold.  
The cross-asset picture suggests markets are *“looking through”* near-term disruption (government shutdown, data freezes) and betting on stimulus,  
but the crowded positioning means any new data or political developments could swing sentiment quickly.
